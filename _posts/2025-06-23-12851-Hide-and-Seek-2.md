12851: 숨바꼭질 2 (Hide and Seek 2) (https://acmicpc.net/problem/12851)

## First Approach
I initially thought that this problem can be solved by top-down dynamic programming, and it turned out that I was wrong.

Let's say the input is n=5 k=10. When we call dp(5), it recursively calls dp(4), dp(3), and so on. 
When it reaches dp(1), it calls dp(0), and dp(0) again calls dp(1), which was not yet been memorized.
This creates a cycle: dp(1) - dp(0) - dp(1).  
and dp(0) calls dp(-1), which returns INF, and dp(1).  

This problem cannot be solved with top-down DP because recursive calls may go back to a state before it has been properly calculated. 
Since operations like +1 and -1 move in both directions, the recursion can revisit the same states again and again, forming a cycle. 
This breaks the assumption that each subproblem is solved only once, and eventually leads to infinite recursion or a stack overflow.

## Wrong Code
```cpp
int dp(int curr)
{
    if (curr > 100 || curr < 0) return INF;

    if (curr == n)
    {
        return 0;
    }

    if (memo[curr] != INF) return memo[curr];

    if (curr % 2) return memo[curr] = min(dp(curr - 1), dp(curr + 1)) + 1;
    else return memo[curr] = min({dp(curr - 1), dp(curr + 1), dp(curr / 2)}) + 1;
}
```

## How to Solve
After I realized my mistake, I tried BFS with memoization.
memo[i] = shortest distance from n to i.
visited[i] = how many times has i been visited.

The first key is that we put the current state into the queue unless memo[next] < nextCnt.
The second key is that when we go from 1 to 3, there should be 2 ways: +1 -> +1 and *2 -> +1.
The fact that 1+1 == 1*2 is equal makes this happens.

I am sure that there will be more organized code, but I just left it behind.

## Passed Code
```cpp
void bfs(int start)
{
    queue<pair<int,int>> q;
    int cnt = 0;
    q.push({start,cnt});
    memo[start] = 0;

    while (!q.empty())
    {
        int curr = q.front().first;
        int currCnt = q.front().second;
        q.pop();

        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        {
            int next;
            int nextCnt = currCnt + 1;
            if (i == 0) next = curr - 1;
            else if (i == 1) next = curr + 1;
            else next = curr * 2;

            if (next >= 0 && next <= 100000)
            {
                if (memo[next] < nextCnt) continue;
                else if (memo[next] > nextCnt) 
                {
                    visited[next] = 0;
                    memo[next] = nextCnt;
                }
                
                q.push({next,nextCnt});
                visited[next]++;
            }
        }
    }    
}
```
